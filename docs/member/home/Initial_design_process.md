# Design Process for HomeScreen

## 1. Visual Hierarchy and User Flow

### Most Important Components:

- **Membership Status**: Critical for the user.
- **Today's Meals**: Immediate relevance.
- **QR Scanner Button**: Frequent use.
- **Points Display**: Always visible.

### Secondary Components:

- **Meal Rating**: Conditional.
- **Absence Planning**: Less frequent use.

This suggests a layout where critical information is immediately visible without scrolling, while secondary features are accessible but don't dominate the screen.

## 2. Layout Optimization

### Screen Real Estate:

- Points display should be compact but prominent.
- Cards should be sized appropriately for content.
- Spacing should follow the 8-point grid system.
- Pull-to-refresh for data updates.

### Navigation:

- QR Scanner button should be easily reachable.
- Modals should have consistent presentation.
- Scrolling should be smooth and deliberate.

This suggests using a `ScrollView` with a sticky header pattern.

## 3. Design System and Color Scheme

### AppBar:

- Use the primaryContainer color.
- Integrate the points display into the AppBar.
- Consistent with Material Design 3 (MD3).

### Cards:

- Use surface color for background.
- Maintain consistent elevation.
- Follow MD3 spacing guidelines.

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Performance Considerations:

- Use `RefreshControl` for pull-to-refresh.
- Implement `useMemo` for expensive computations.
- Lazy load modals.
- Use `React.memo` for pure components.

### Screen Structure:

- Separate layout logic from business logic.
- Keep animations on the native thread.
- Handle safe area insets properly.

## 5. Development Order

### HomeScreen Development Steps:

1. Base screen structure with AppBar and ScrollView.
2. Card container components with proper styling.
3. Basic layout with placeholder content.
4. Add pull-to-refresh functionality.
5. Implement proper safe area handling.

Proceed with creating the HomeScreen layout.

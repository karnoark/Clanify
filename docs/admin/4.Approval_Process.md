# Approval Process Documentation

## Overview

The approval process is a critical component of our system that ensures quality control and verification of mess registrations. This process is managed through Supabase's database functions and triggers, with the actual approval being performed via the Supabase Studio interface.

## Approval Flow

1. **Submission**
   When an admin completes all onboarding steps, the system triggers a series of validations before changing their status to 'verification_pending'. This change signals that the registration is ready for review by the platform administrator.

2. **Review Process**
   The platform administrator reviews the submission through Supabase Studio, where they can:
   - View all registration details in a structured format
   - Access uploaded media files
   - Verify contact information
   - Review operating hours and specialties
   - Check location details

3. **Approval Action**
   To approve a registration, the administrator executes the approval function:
   ```sql
   SELECT approve_mess_registration(
       'registration-uuid-here',
       'All documents verified. Location and facilities meet standards.'
   );
   ```

4. **System Actions**
   The `approve_mess_registration` function performs several critical operations in a single transaction:
   - Validates the registration status and data completeness
   - Updates user roles across the system
   - Creates a new mess entry with the provided information
   - Records the approval action with notes

## Data Transformation Process

### 1. JSON Data Handling
The system carefully transforms JSON data stored in the registration to structured database columns:

```sql
-- Basic Information
SELECT 
    (mess_details->>'name')::text as name,
    (mess_details->>'description')::text as description,
    (mess_details->>'type')::mess_type as type,
    (mess_details->>'capacity')::integer as capacity
FROM admin_registrations;
```

### 2. Nested Address Data
Location information is stored in a nested structure that needs careful extraction:

```sql
-- Address extraction with proper JSON path navigation
SELECT 
    location_details->'address'->>'street' as street,
    location_details->'address'->>'area' as area,
    location_details->'address'->>'city' as city,
    location_details->'address'->>'state' as state,
    location_details->'address'->>'pincode' as pincode
FROM admin_registrations;
```

### 3. Geographic Coordinates
Coordinates are converted to PostgreSQL's native point type for geospatial queries:

```sql
SELECT point(
    (location_details->'coordinates'->>'latitude')::float,
    (location_details->'coordinates'->>'longitude')::float
) as location
FROM admin_registrations;
```

### 4. Array and Specialty Handling
Specialty dishes are stored as a JSON array and need conversion to PostgreSQL arrays:

```sql
SELECT ARRAY(
    SELECT jsonb_array_elements_text(mess_details->'specialties')
) as specialties
FROM admin_registrations;
```

## Error Handling and Validation

The approval process includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Pre-approval Validation**
```sql
IF v_registration.status != 'verification_pending' THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Registration is not in verification_pending state. Current state: %', 
        v_registration.status;
END IF;
```

2. **Data Completeness Check**
```sql
IF v_registration.mess_details IS NULL OR 
   v_registration.location_details IS NULL OR 
   v_registration.contact_details IS NULL OR 
   v_registration.timing_details IS NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Registration data is incomplete';
END IF;
```

3. **Transaction Safety**
```sql
-- Update operations are wrapped in a transaction
BEGIN
    -- Updates to auth.users
    -- Updates to profiles
    -- Creation of mess entry
    -- Status update
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Log the error
    RAISE NOTICE 'Error in approval process: %', SQLERRM;
    RAISE;
END;
```

## Post-Approval Effects

After successful approval:

1. **User Access**
   - The user gains immediate access to admin features
   - Their role changes in both auth.users and profiles tables
   - They can access the mess management interface

2. **Data Availability**
   - The mess becomes visible in the platform's search
   - Contact information becomes available to potential customers
   - Operating hours are published and searchable

3. **Record Keeping**
   - The approval is logged with timestamp and notes
   - Original registration data is preserved for reference
   - The mess entry becomes the primary source of business information

## Administrator Guidelines

When reviewing registrations for approval:

1. **Document Verification**
   - Verify that all uploaded photos are clear and appropriate
   - Check that the location details match the provided address
   - Ensure contact information is valid and reachable

2. **Data Quality**
   - Review operating hours for completeness and logic
   - Check that pricing information is reasonable and clear
   - Verify that specialties are properly listed and categorized

3. **Business Legitimacy**
   - Confirm the establishment details are credible
   - Verify that the location is appropriate for a mess business
   - Check that contact details belong to the business owner

## Security Considerations

The approval system implements several security measures:

1. **Role-Based Access**
   - Only authorized administrators can execute the approval function
   - All approval actions are logged with the approver's ID
   - Changes to critical data require proper authentication

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Row-level locking prevents concurrent modifications
   - Transactions ensure atomicity of the approval process
   - Data validation prevents incomplete or invalid approvals

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All status changes are timestamped
   - Approval notes are preserved
   - Original registration data is maintained for reference

# Admin Onboarding Supabase Integration

Here's a complete overview of all steps needed for a secure and user-friendly admin registration workflow:

1. **Admin Registration Initiation**

   - User selects "Admin" role during signup
   - Instead of creating account immediately, store initial data in admin_registrations table
   - Status: 'pending_onboarding'
   - WHY: Prevents unauthorized admin account creation before verification

2. **Onboarding Information Collection**

   - Proceed through your existing 5 steps:
     - Mess Details
     - Location
     - Contact
     - Timing
     - Media (documents & photos)
   - Store data in admin_registrations table as they complete each step
   - Status updates to: 'onboarding_completed'
   - WHY: Ensures all necessary business information is collected systematically

3. **Document Verification Stage**

   - After onboarding completion, status changes to 'verification_pending'
   - Show user a confirmation screen indicating their application is under review
   - Send you (superadmin) a notification about new pending verification
   - WHY: Clear communication of application status to both admin and superadmin

4. **Superadmin Review (Through Supabase Dashboard)**

   - Review submitted information and documents
   - Two possible actions:
     a. Approve: Creates actual admin account with proper role
     b. Reject: Marks registration as rejected with reason
   - WHY: Central control over admin approvals, no need for separate admin interface

5. **Post-Review Communication**
   - If Approved:
     - Create actual admin account
     - Send email with login credentials
     - Status changes to 'approved'
   - If Rejected:
     - Send email with rejection reason
     - Status changes to 'rejected'
   - WHY: Clear communication of decision and next steps

This flow ensures:

1. Security: No unauthorized admin accounts
2. Completeness: All required information collected
3. Verifiability: Proper document verification
4. Auditability: Complete registration history
5. Simplicity: Manageable through Supabase dashboard

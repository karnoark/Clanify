# Admin Onboarding Flow Documentation

## Overview

The admin onboarding system is a sophisticated multi-step process that enables mess owners (admins) to register and set up their mess business on our platform. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the technical implementation and business logic behind the admin onboarding flow.

## Process Flow

1. **Initial Registration**
   - User signs up with the 'admin_verification_pending' role
   - Entry created in auth.users and profiles tables
   - Automatic entry created in admin_registrations with 'pending_onboarding' status

2. **Onboarding Steps**
   - Mess Details (Basic Information)
   - Location Information
   - Contact Details
   - Operating Hours
   - Media Upload

3. **Verification Stage**
   - Admin completes all steps
   - Status changes to 'verification_pending'
   - Platform owner reviews submission
   - Approval/Rejection process

4. **Post-Approval**
   - Role changes from 'admin_verification_pending' to 'admin'
   - Mess entry created
   - Admin gains access to mess management features
